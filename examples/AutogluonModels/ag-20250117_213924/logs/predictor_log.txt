Beginning AutoGluon training...
AutoGluon will save models to '/Users/jerald/Documents/Dir/Python/TimeSeriesModels/examples/AutogluonModels/ag-20250117_214149'

train_data with frequency 'None' has been resampled to frequency 'B'.
Provided train_data has 7845 rows (NaN fraction=10.8%), 2 time series. Median time series length is 3922 (min=1803, max=6042). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MAPE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.

Starting training. Start time is 2025-01-17 16:41:53
Models that will be trained: ['Chronos[autogluon__chronos-bolt-base]']
Training timeseries model Chronos[autogluon__chronos-bolt-base]. 
	-0.3914       = Validation score (-MAPE)
	0.01    s     = Training runtime
	2.24    s     = Validation (prediction) runtime
Not fitting ensemble as only 1 model was trained.
